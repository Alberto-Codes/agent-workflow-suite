## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
Develop a Python application that transforms 2-5 minute browser workflow recordings into structured training data for AI agents. The system analyzes screen recordings to extract both technical workflow steps and business decision logic, generating three specific artifacts designed for consumption by downstream Gemini AI agents equipped with Playwright automation tools.

### Business Justification
- **AI Agent Training Acceleration**: Dramatically reduce time to train workflow automation agents
- **Knowledge Capture**: Preserve institutional knowledge from observed workflows
- **Scalable Documentation**: Convert ad-hoc processes into reusable AI training data
- **Business Logic Preservation**: Capture decision-making patterns that traditional automation misses

### Investment Required
- **Timeline**: 14-16 weeks development
- **Team**: 2-3 developers + 1 AI/ML specialist
- **Technology**: Google ADK, Gemini Flash 2.0 licensing

## Problem Statement & Solution

### Current Challenge
Organizations struggle to train AI agents for browser-based workflows because:
- Manual coding of automation is time-intensive and brittle
- Business logic and decision criteria are rarely documented
- Screen recordings contain rich information but lack structured extraction
- Existing tools generate technical steps but miss the "why" behind decisions

### Our Solution
A specialized analysis tool that extracts both technical workflow steps AND business decision patterns from screen recordings, outputting three AI-agent-ready artifacts that enable intelligent workflow replication.

## Product Scope & Deliverables

### Core Functionality
Transform browser workflow recordings into AI agent training data through automated analysis and quality validation.

### Three Output Artifacts

#### 1. Playwright Reference Script
- **Purpose**: Starting point for AI agents with Playwright automation tools
- **Format**: Python script with extensive comments
- **Contents**: Browser interactions, element selection patterns, workflow structure
- **Note**: Provides automation foundation; elements may require AI agent adaptation

#### 2. Natural Language Workflow Guide
- **Purpose**: Human-readable description with business context for AI interpretation  
- **Format**: Structured text with embedded metadata
- **Contents**: 
  - Step-by-step process descriptions with timestamps
  - Business decision criteria and logic
  - Intent classification for each action
  - Context clues and conditional information
  - Expected outcomes and validation points

#### 3. Standard Operating Procedure
- **Purpose**: Compliance documentation using industry templates
- **Format**: Markdown following established standards (ISO 9001, ITIL, COSO)
- **Contents**: 
  - Process overview and business objectives
  - Detailed procedures with decision criteria
  - Quality checkpoints and business rules
  - Exception handling and escalation procedures

### Target Consumer
**Downstream Gemini AI agents** equipped with generic Playwright tool wrappers (navigate, inspect elements, interact with UI, etc.) that need both technical guidance and business context understanding.

### Key Capabilities Required

#### 1. Multimodal Video Analysis
- Frame extraction and UI element identification
- User action recognition and sequencing
- Timestamp correlation and workflow mapping

#### 2. Business Logic Extraction
- **Decision Pattern Recognition**: Identify what drives user choices
- **Intent Classification**: Understand why actions are taken
- **Context Analysis**: Capture environmental factors influencing decisions
- **Rule Inference**: Derive business rules from observed patterns

#### 3. Quality Assurance System
- **Code Execution Validation**: Use ADK interpreter to test Playwright scripts
- **Multi-Agent Critique**: Specialized validation agents for each artifact type
- **Iterative Refinement**: Automated improvement cycles with quality thresholds

## Quality Assurance & Validation

### Built-in Quality System
The system includes automated quality assurance as a core feature, not optional validation:

#### Code Execution Agent
- **Static Analysis**: Validate Playwright script syntax and structure
- **Mock Execution**: Test script logic using ADK interpreter tools
- **Error Detection**: Identify and suggest fixes for common issues
- **Quality Scoring**: Rate script viability and reliability

#### Multi-Agent Validation
- **Workflow Accuracy Critic**: Verifies technical steps match video evidence
- **Business Logic Critic**: Validates captured intent and decision patterns
- **Documentation Critic**: Ensures compliance with selected templates
- **AI Agent Usability Critic**: Evaluates artifacts from downstream agent perspective

#### Iterative Improvement
- **Refinement Cycles**: Automatic improvement loops (default 3 iterations)
- **Quality Thresholds**: Configurable acceptance criteria (default 85% accuracy)
- **Convergence Tracking**: Monitor improvement progression and success rates

---

## Success Metrics & Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Performance
- **Processing Time**: <10 minutes end-to-end for 5-minute recordings
- **Workflow Accuracy**: >90% correct step identification post-validation
- **Script Viability**: >85% of Playwright scripts execute without critical errors

### Business Value Metrics
- **Intent Capture**: >80% accurate business decision pattern extraction
- **AI Agent Success**: >85% of downstream agents successfully execute workflows using artifacts
- **Time Savings**: Reduce workflow documentation time from hours to minutes
- **Knowledge Retention**: Capture business logic that would otherwise be lost

### Quality Gates
- All three artifacts must pass automated validation before output
- Business logic extraction must achieve minimum confidence scores
- Generated procedures must comply with selected industry templates
- Code execution validation must confirm script structural integrity
