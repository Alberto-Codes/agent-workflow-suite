> **AI-Powered Browser Workflow Automation Suite**  
> Transform screen recordings into intelligent workflow automation with built-in quality assurance and comprehensive audit trails.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Agent Workflow Suite is a comprehensive AI-powered system that revolutionizes browser workflow automation through intelligent analysis and execution. The suite consists of two interconnected components that work together to capture, analyze, and execute complex browser-based workflows with human-level intelligence and decision-making capabilities.

### Core Components

1. **[Screen Recording Workflow Analyzer](#-screen-recording-workflow-analyzer)** - Transforms 2-5 minute browser recordings into structured AI training data
2. **[AI Workflow Execution Agent](#-ai-workflow-execution-agent)** - Executes workflows intelligently using the generated training data with built-in QA validation

## üé• Screen Recording Workflow Analyzer

### Purpose
Converts browser workflow screen recordings into three structured artifacts designed for AI agent consumption, capturing both technical steps and business decision logic.

### Key Features
- **Multimodal Video Analysis** using Gemini Flash 2.0
- **Business Logic Extraction** - Captures the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- **Quality Assurance System** with automated validation and iterative refinement
- **Three-Artifact Output** optimized for downstream AI agents

### Generated Artifacts

#### 1. Playwright Reference Script
- **Purpose**: Technical automation foundation for AI agents
- **Format**: Python script with extensive comments
- **Contents**: Browser interactions, element selection patterns, workflow structure
- **Usage**: Starting point for AI agents with Playwright automation tools

#### 2. Natural Language Workflow Guide
- **Purpose**: Human-readable description with business context
- **Format**: Structured text with embedded metadata
- **Contents**: 
  - Step-by-step process descriptions with timestamps
  - Business decision criteria and logic
  - Intent classification for each action
  - Context clues and conditional information
  - Expected outcomes and validation points

#### 3. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
- **Purpose**: Compliance documentation using industry templates
- **Format**: Markdown following established standards (ISO 9001, ITIL, COSO)
- **Contents**: 
  - Process overview and business objectives
  - Detailed procedures with decision criteria
  - Quality checkpoints and business rules
  - Exception handling and escalation procedures

### System Inputs
- **Workflow Artifacts** from Screen Recording Analyzer
- **Work Queue** (CSV file with items to process)
- **Configuration** (execution parameters and quality thresholds)

### System Outputs
- **Completion Report** (CSV with processed items and status)
- **Validation Artifacts** (screenshots, logs, URLs for audit verification)
- **Execution Log** (detailed action-by-action documentation)
- **Quality Metrics** (success rates, error patterns, performance data)

### ADK Callback System Integration

The system leverages Google ADK's three-level callback architecture:

#### Level 1: Action-Level Callbacks
- Automatic screenshot capture before/after browser actions
- Immediate validation of action completion
- Real-time error detection and response

#### Level 2: Step-Level Callbacks
- Workflow progress validation at logical checkpoints
- Business rule compliance verification
- QA agent reasoning triggers

#### Level 3: Workflow-Level Callbacks
- Final completion validation
- Comprehensive audit trail generation
- Quality metrics collection and reporting
