## ü§ñ Component 2: AI Workflow Execution Agent

### Purpose & Innovation
Intelligently executes browser workflows using training artifacts from the Screen Recording Analyzer, processing CSV work queues with built-in QA validation and comprehensive audit trails through ADK's three-level callback architecture.

### ADK Callback-Driven Architecture

The system leverages Google ADK's three-level callback system for automated quality assurance and audit trail generation:

#### Level 1: Action-Level Callbacks (@callback.on_action)
**Automatic Operations**:
- Screenshot capture before/after each browser action
- Real-time validation of action success  
- Error detection and immediate response
- Action logging with context and results

```python
@callback.on_action(trigger="before")
def pre_action_callback(context):
    screenshot_path = take_screenshot(f"before_{context.action_name}")
    current_state = validate_page_state()
    log_action_intent(context.action_name, context.parameters)
    
    return {
        "screenshot": screenshot_path,
        "state_valid": current_state.is_valid,
        "ready_for_action": True
    }
```

#### Level 2: Step-Level Callbacks (@callback.on_step)  
**Quality Checkpoints**:
- Workflow progress validation at logical milestones

- Step-level error recovery coordination

#### Level 3: Workflow-Level Callbacks (@callback.on_workflow)
**Comprehensive Validation**:
- Final workflow completion verification
- Complete audit trail generation
- Quality metrics collection and reporting
- Evidence package compilation for compliance
